# UFOs Sightings Project - "Are UFOs real?"

## Project Overview

The project is to use JavaScript and CSS styling to create a vivid and clean looking web page, viewable via html, to share data/sightings about UFOs.  The requestor of the web site is a journalist that wants to report sightings of UFOs to their readers. CSS styling was used to bring in an image wihtin the header and the background and font colors were updated within the style sheet, as well. The page contains an image and a brief introduction into UFO sightings.  The final piece of this site is a table that displays the following fields, Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration and Comments for each instance of a sighting.   

## Project Results

The data was provided as a data.js file and the app.js file is used to parse the data and transform it to share in a user friendly table format.  A table is created to nicely display the UFO sightings. Within the project, I added filters for the user to have the ability to sort the dataset by any of the column headings.

ðŸ’¡ Suggestions for utilizing the site: 

Now that there are filters for each column, readers could find this dataset useful by sorting by various items.  The dataset is very large so without the use of filters, it is impossible to view all of the rows. The search feature is user friendly and returns results quickly.  The user simple clicks within the text box of their preferred field to search and types in a value for that field. Each text box for the searchable columns contains a 'placeholder' that provides an example of each field as a guide to show the user how to type in their value.

* Search Example 1: 
Sorting by state may allow for a user to understand where within their state sightings occur most. Once they have this information they could possibly visit these sites.

* Search Example 2: 
Sorting the table by shape could be useful for a reader to understand similarities among sightings with the same shape referenced.

## Project Summary
There is a significant amount of data to share with the readers concerning UFO sightings.  The tools used within this project help to provide a more manageable experience with the large dataset.  This allows for a more fluid review of the dataset.  

*Drawback*

There is a drawback that I see within the web page.  That is the lack of pagination to successfully see the entire dataset.  Without this feature, the user is limited upon initial load to view only the first result set.  That restricts the user from seeing all values for the dates, it's impossible to see how many years this dataset covers.

*Recommendations*

Two additional recommendations would be to use web scraping functionality and to share a graph of the data.  
  1. Web Scraping would be a real time wonderful feature that could scrape several UFO enthusiast web sites to pull in the most recent stories and data of UFO sightings.  This would help keep the web site fresh and relevant regardless of how much time passes from the creation of the dataset being pulled in.  Scraping other web sites also allows for the site to cover other types of data surrouding UFO sightings without the maintenance task for Dana to keep it current. 
  2. Graph the Dataset would provide a significant amount of insight into the dataset with just a glance.  The readers could get a clear perspective as to what is covered and shared within the table.  The graph would help the user while determining which fields to filter on and would provide an eye pleasing summary of the dataset.
